# Cowboy Shoot 'Em: Game Description
Gameplay: This is a one-on-one, fast-paced arcade game pitting you against an AI opponent in a Western-style duel. The goal is to outsmart and outshoot your rival, Mac, to be the last one standing. A successful hit is a one-shot kill.

Round-Based Action: The game is broken into rounds with a decreasing number of bullets loaded into your revolver.

Round 1: 3 bullets

Round 2: 2 bullets

Final Round: 1 bullet

Actions: Each turn, you have three options to choose from using a simple, three-button control scheme:

Shoot: Fire your weapon. Be careful, as you have limited bullets.

Duck: Evade an incoming shot. This makes you invulnerable for the turn.

Remain Standing: This is a risky move. While you can be shot, successfully remaining standing allows you to lasso your opponent in the next round, making them lose their turn and leaving them vulnerable to your next attack.

Winning the Game: The first player to successfully land a shot on the opponent wins. If all six bullets are used and no one has been hit, the player who chose to fire the most often is declared the winner.

Animated Scenes: The game features a variety of key animations that bring the Western showdown to life, including:

Revolver bullet loading and spinning

Players shooting, ducking, and getting lassoed

Close-ups of each character's face

A side view of the Western town arena with tumbleweeds blowing

Animations for both Mac's and the player's defeat

Controls: The game features a simple, arcade-style menu and controls. A joystick and a single select button are used to navigate the main menu and adjust volume, while the three action buttons control the in-game actions.
